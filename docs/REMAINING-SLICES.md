# Native Animation package status

Packaged on upstream main `bdd4c9150f` as 0.8.1 with a Native Animation launcher
tab/headset block and recommended fresh defaults. H and S retained. Z (Y-zip
ownership), C (swing-blend polish), legs and known 0xC0000409 crash investigation
were out of scope for the package. Z and C are now on `feat/native-animation` (web zips
are ANIM from the press frame, held for the zip; swing blends start on the shown
view and end on the new owner's, travelling with the player, 180 ms kept; not
headset-tested). Head-neck seat (N) is on it too: every owner switch starts the head
lock afresh and every move change, Y zip, HEAD change or recenter glides the
reference back to the headset (180 ms, look kept; 35 cm backstop) so room drift
cannot pile up off the neck; not headset-tested. The error / state-change pass is on
it as well: with ARMS the OG body now fades out over the view's 180 ms on SpidyVR ->
animation (it vanished on the first frame while the view glided, so the neck was not
under the view), a Y zip from a swing no longer gets the landing's facing stick, and
the vr->anim / headbone diag values are real; owner rules and timings unchanged; not
headset-tested. J (jump-adopt) is on it: a real jump or leap the player asked for on the
ground (A, the game's A, a charged leap, SPIDY RUN JUMP) goes to SpidyVR on the
leave-ground frame (`hybrid_owner` EnterVr::jump; not in a fight, zip, crawl, on a wall
or in the game's parkour; within 0.5 s of the ask); the pose job snapshots the live
authored pose and seeds the body from it (`body::seedFromPose`: hips' heading, weight
from 0, arms at full weight at once), legs keep the jump's shape in the air; a jump the
game's crawl mounts onto a wall goes back to ANIM (EnterAnim::mount); landing by the
existing rules; not headset-tested. L (momentum swing-leg look) is on it: when
SpidyVR owns the air (a swing or an adopted leap) the existing thigh-shin-foot
chains keep that pose and trail it with velocity and spin, damped and capped, so
they read as weight; kick / wall-run / crawl / grounded and ANIM-owned hops stay
as they were; no new setting; not headset-tested. T (visual tuck) is on it:
hold B (dodge, not trigger or grip) while SpidyVR owns the air and the same
chains ease toward knees-to-chest and back, matching the arms' ease; kick /
wall-run / crawl / grounded stay as they were; no new setting; not
headset-tested. P (physics coupling) is on it too: the eased tuck feeds the
swing's existing spin drag and air steering (knees in = lower inertia / faster
spin / less angular drag / a bit more air steer; untucked is unchanged); no
new setting; not headset-tested. No further approved slice after P. No custom offsets; docs/REFERENCE.md and VALIDATION.md remain
the executable evidence. Packaging merge has not been headset-tested.

# Remaining after feat/animated-hybrid-owner

## Delivered
1. Flesh-out stack (dedicated yaw → softlock → hands-webs) @ `3ddbe36`
2. **Slice 1 — ANIMATED HYBRID** FSM + setting (default Off)
3. **Slices 2+3 — clean G↔T handoff** (this tip): `adoptEyes` re-anchor,
   warm `beginReclaim`, 180 ms eye/yaw blend both ways, delayed arms wipe on
   G→T, delayed MODEL YAW + actor-yaw seed on T→G, no `adoptFeet` on hybrid land.
   MODEL YAW sign fixed (+R turns hero right with −Z actor ahead).
4. **Intent owner (Slice A)** — animation is the default owner; OG VR only on
   web attach / airborne web press / mid-air rotate / airborne speed ≥ 15 m/s /
   Spidy wall run. 500 ms VR minimum, 250 ms land confirm. Head follow = owner
   (`animOwns`), no per-frame classify drop. ANIMATED HYBRID SPEED row: speed
   hold OFF or 5–500 ms (200 default).
5. **Parkour steering (Slice B)** — left stick view-relative while the animation
   owns (`hybrid_steer.hpp`); ANIMATED STEERING bypassed under HYBRID; CameraLook
   follows the view unless the R-stick turns.

## Next
- **Slice C:** done as endpoint/travel polish at 180 ms (no longer window); retune only after a headset check
- **Slice 4+:** OG air immersion (momentum lean, swing-arc legs, web-arm tension)

## Headset check for Hybrid handoff
MOVES on, HYBRID on, AIR / ONLY / AIR SPIN off, HEAD Full, ARMS/TORSO/MODEL YAW on.
- Parkour, hops, jumps, game zips, crawls: stay on the animation, head on the body;
  `hybrid: anim->vr` should appear only for web / air-web / rotate / speed / wallrun
- Web attach or mid-air turn: no view snap; look for `hybrid: anim->vr (…) … G->T … eyes dPos`
- Land into run/fight: blend back; `hybrid: vr->anim (land …)` with land ≥ 500 ms
- R-stick on ground: +X turns the hero right (same sense as OG SpidyVR)
- L-stick in a full circle while running and over rooftops: he heads where you push,
  relative to your view; `hybrid steer: … sent L(…)` once a second

## Tabled
- Legs redesign
- True chest perch eyes offset

## Hands / run-and-turn follow-up (2026-11-06 PT)

- H: HYBRID hands share the resolved animated eye frame, continuous tracked
  overlay with existing ramps, same-solve diagnostics/tests. Not headset-tested.
- S: preserve run magnitude while turning; share pad/native ground heading and
  gate hidden rig yaw. Not headset-tested.
- Z (Y-zip immediate animation ownership) and C (exact blend endpoints / slight
  view smoothing) remain separate and unimplemented. Legs remain tabled.
