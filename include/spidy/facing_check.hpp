// FACING CHECK (the user, November 12 07:14: "there are times where it turns me 180 on
// landing or launch. Maybe we need a check on each event").
//
// On each ownership event - a landing, a point launch, the timed jump handoff, the
// animation taking the hero back for anything else (re-entry), and any other SpidyVR
// takeover - the facing the player expects is known just before it: the view the
// headset showed (for a point launch, the launch direction when the player launched
// roughly where they looked; a backward launch off a wall keeps the view). Right after
// it, within a few frames, the view and (while the animation owns him) the hero's facing
// are compared against it:
//  - the view more than 45 degrees off what was shown is a turn the player did not make:
//    it is put back (the anim view's yaw lock, or the tracking rig's yaw in SpidyVR);
//  - the hero more than 90 degrees off is the game's facing (the actor's own, stale or
//    the move's), not the player's: the walk stick turns him to it (TURN-IN-PLACE's
//    closed loop, forced, no facing write).
// Each logs 'facing check: <event> <view|hero> expected X got Y (ok|corrected|...)'.
//
// The 06:37 session (319e734): at 52 of 199 yaw-lock latches the head bone (the SpidyVR
// body, under the view) and the actor's facing were more than 135 degrees apart; after a
// landing the game's animation turned the hero onto the actor's facing within ~0.3 s,
// and TURN-IN-PLACE fixed only 8 of the 52 landings where he ended more than 90 degrees
// off the view (18 interrupted, 26 never ran). No game address is guessed here.
